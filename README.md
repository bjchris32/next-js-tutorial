* Take away:
NextJS use `Client Component` and `Server Component` to render the page.
NextJS uses `Server Component` to share the components across pages. 
`Client Component` is used to interact with users and store states.

`Server Component` is used as default in NextJs to boost performance in browser. The only problem we need to solve is to figure out which component should be interactive, and hence, set it as `Client Component`.
